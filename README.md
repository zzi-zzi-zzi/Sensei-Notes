(requires some work by the sensi master)

 -  [x] Equip Items
 -  [x] Track Quests  (the button in the bottom left of the quest log) -- Meh one quest. kindof minor. 
 -  [ ] Teleport - Story Quest Required -- can currently be done via UI manipulation. Not sure how accurately this can be done.
 
 -  [x] Fuse Items - Story Quest Required -- Currently can be done via UI manipulation. 
   -  [ ] Would be nice to be able to get information about the Item Selection Windows to have better control over whats going to be used

 -  [ ] Cutscene Skipping
   -  [ ] Cutscenes currently break tags. (have to stop and start the bot to get it moving again) 

 -  [x] Read The Letter - Story Quest Required.
 -  [x] Remote Turn in? (meh imo)
 
 -  [x] `Start location tile could not be loaded.`
